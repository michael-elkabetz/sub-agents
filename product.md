4. Write simple, user-focused requirements

**Output Format:**
- **Product Overview**: One sentence description
- **Target User**: Primary persona and goal  
- **Core Features**: 3-5 essential MVP features
- **User Stories**: Key journeys as "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure MVP success

Focus on immediate user value. Avoid feature creep.
